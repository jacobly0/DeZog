    Sources-Mode: The list file is used to find the association between the source files (your assembler files) with the step addresses. When you step through the code you step through your source files.

The mode is determined by the "srcDirs" launch.json parameter. This is an array which contains the directories where source file can be located. If the array has length 0 (is empty) ListFile-Mode is assumed. If directories are given Sources-Mode is assumed.


parseLabelAndAddress(line: string). It is called subsequently for each line of the list file.
You need to extract the label and address. I.e. all labels at the start of the line (normally ended by a ":") and all EQUs and their value. Note: You may omit EQUs if they are too complicated to parse, e.g. if these contain are calculation of other labels.
Then call ```addLabelForNumber(value: number, label: string)```` to associate the label (or EQU) name with the value (address or number). If your assembler can differentiate local and global labels you should also add the LabelType.
To set the number of associated bytes with one address you need to call addAddressLine(address: number, size: number). I.e. in your list file you should parse the address and then count the number of following bytes and pass both to the addAddressLine. Calling this function is necessary to associate the label with the address.

In the second pass the file names and line numbers are associated with the addresses. This is done in parseAllFilesAndLineNumbers. It calls parseFileAndLineNumber(line: string) for each line.
parseFileAndLineNumber(line: string) has to determine the include file start and end by calling includeStart(fname) and includeEnd(). And it has to determine the line number in the file. Note: this is not the line number of the list file. The list file may include other files. It's the line number of those files we are after. Call 'setLineNumber' with the line number to set it. Note that source file numbers start at 0.
